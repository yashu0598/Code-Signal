Determine if it is possible to rearrange the characters in a string to obtain another string.

Example

For word1 = "abc" and word2 = "cab", the output should be
symbolsPermutation(word1, word2) = true;
For word1 = "aaaa" and word2 = "aaa", the output should be
symbolsPermutation(word1, word2) = false.
